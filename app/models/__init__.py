"""Database models package initialization.

This file should include:
- Exports of all database models
- Makes models easily importable from app.models

Example:
    from app.models.user import User
    from app.models.board import Board
    from app.models.column import Column
    from app.models.task import Task
    from app.models.comment import Comment
    from app.models.attachment import Attachment
    
    __all__ = [
        'User',
        'Board',
        'Column',
        'Task',
        'Comment',
        'Attachment',
    ]
"""
